        <p style="color:orange"><center> Greetings World! I am beyond thrilled you have successfully been able to navigate to this page. This shows great success in our product and code. By reading this, you have confirmed successfull operational status for our website and therefore our product. Without further a due, let me tell you about Disaster Mapper!</center></p>
        <p style="color:black">Disaster Mapper is a versatile online web application, which utilizes a combinaiton of front end and back end development, as well as, the integration and implementation of various API's, such as the Google Maps API. This project was spearheaded and collaborated on by a joint multi-racial, multi-ethnic team of extremely bright and intellectual first years at Santa Clara University! This team consisted of Carter Duncan, Alexander Kennedy, Ari Sorianno, Zak Graber, Matthew Zang and Teddy Nguyen. Over a long (yet lovely) non-stop continuous 24 hour period, this beautiful website was brainstormed, discussed, programmed, tweaked and finalized, resulting in a global platform that can accept user input, in the form of picures of local natural disasters in their area, which can be viewed by other residents or first responders. This will allow first responders to monitor the condition and severtiy of the area affected and the damage inflcited. When they move in to assisst and rescue victims they'll be able to monitor live feedback and updates of streets and neighborhoods, such as which streets are the most flooded, if some are blocked by trees or downed power lines etc. Overall, we are all very thrilled with our hard work and effort, in addition to our final product. We all loved collarboarting, learning and socializing together on this amazing project. </p>
